# LMCTL

LMCTL is a command-line client that provides commands for interacting with Telco Network Cloud Orchestrator (TNCO/ALM) environments. 

In addition it includes an opinionated pattern for managing xNF/Network Service designs during the CICD lifecycle, as file based projects, to produce packages suitable for production release.

This version of LMCTL supports TNCO version 1.2+ (ALM version 2.2+).

You may still be able to manage LMCTL projects in older ALM versions by updating your lmproject file (see [Using with ALM 2.1](use-with-lm-2.1.md))
