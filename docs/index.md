# Overview
# Lmctl

LMCTL is a command-line client for the Stratossâ„¢ Lifecycle Manager (Stratoss LM) that provides commands for interacting with LM environments. It includes an opinionated pattern for managing service designs during the CICD lifecycle as projects, to produce packages suitable for release into production.

The tool may also be used to manage deployment locations and drivers in Stratoss LM environments.

This version of LMCTL supports LM version 2.2+  but may also be used with 2.1 versions by updating your lmproject file (see [Using with LM 2.1](use-with-lm-2.1.md))
