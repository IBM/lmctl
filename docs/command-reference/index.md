#  Command Reference

# Command Help Pages

We aim to maintain readable and useful help pages which can be accessed directly from lmctl:

```
lmctl --help

lmctl create --help
lmctl delete --help

lmctl create assembly --help
lmctl create descriptor --help 
```

We recommend referring to these when learning the commands. If you find they are unclear or not helpful, please raise a Github issue with your feedback so we can improve them :speech_balloon:
